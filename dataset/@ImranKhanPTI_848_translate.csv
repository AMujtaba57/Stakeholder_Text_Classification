403,403,"Raise your voice to protest the violations that are pointed out by the powerful forces in the international community but when it comes to massive human rights violations at the hands of India and IIOJ&K, these same forces are completely silent due to their strategic military cooperation with the Indian market."

446,446,"A proper judicial investigation must be instituted to examine his own statements plus evidence that other sources have. We have descended into a state of brutality, unknown in civilised society, indulged in by the powerful against those who dare to criticise & expose wrongdoings"
447,447,"Despite the closure of Lahore by a gang of criminals (see map) and the arrest of 2,000 of our workers, the people of Lahore came out in large numbers to make our 6th Jalsa at the Lahore Minar, Pakistan a great success.

453,453,Imported govt has taken media & journalists' censorship & persecution to fascistic levels. Now Bol has been suspended simply because it gave us coverage. Message to all media houses is to blackout the largest & most popular national pol party from mainstream media. Unacceptable.

460,460,Rangers firing straight into unarmed citizens at Zaman Park as if they are attacking an enemy force on the battlefield.
461,461,There is no doubt that we have now become a republic. Now the law of the jungle prevails where the rule of the buffalo is ruled by the stick and the constitution and laws are completely subordinated to today's pharaohs.
462,462,"If this is the sort of elections ECP, the State & PDM want then the stability that elections are meant to bring will not happen. Instead such manipulated elections will only cause more agitation, polarisation & anarchy."
463,463,NRO 1 cost this nation dearly. The loot & plunder of these two crooked families & their associates increased our debt four times in ten years. NRO2 is even more shameful. Rs 1100 billion corruption cases are being given immunity. Daylight robbery!
464,464,"If they express their reaction, they are put in jail and more or less 15 papers are cut against them across the country. I ask my honorable judges again, where is the justice in all this?

I want to ask the Hon'ble Supreme Court if they are not aware of this disaster?"
479,479,I will be doing media talk 4 pm today. Fawad's arrest on his apt description of the CEC leaves no doubt in anyone's mind that Pak has become a banana republic devoid of rule of law. We must stand up for our  fundamental rights now to save Pak's drift towards a point of no return.

497,497,This nation has paid a heavy price for NRO-1. The looting of these two criminal families and their followers increased our debt four times in ten years. NRO 2 is even more embarrassing! 1100 billion rupees corruption cases are being given amnesty and immunity. It is a robbery on the pockets of the nation!
498,498,"Why did patrons stand in the way of EVMs? EVMs enable transparency and instant availability of results, which closes the door to rigging and manipulation of results. The results of the local elections, which were supposed to be out in a few hours in most places, were received with an inexplicable delay of several days."
499,499,"I am launching our election campaign from Lahore with a rally tomorrow afternoon. InshaAllah we will mobilise Punjab & KP for record turnout in what will be a historic election. PTI will take on PDM parties & their backers, who shd have been neutral umpires, plus state machinery."

767,767,"Under which law they broke the main door of the house, uprooted trees and entered the house with heavy weapons? This is the limit of absurdity. They did all this when I had left for Islamabad to appear in court and Bushra Bibi, who is a complete housewife."
768,768,"It is a shame to see the depravity that we as Pakistanis have fallen into at the hands of this imported criminal government and their patrons.
